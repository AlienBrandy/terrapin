/**
 * datastream.h
 * 
 * Datastreams represent system inputs and outputs that are shared with the outside world.
 * The datastream object model stores the input/output value, the timestamp of the last 
 * update, and other const metadata to help identify and interpret the value. The datastream's 
 * value is a scalar quantity stored internally as a double precision floating point.
 * The value can be cast to any datatype that fits in a double.
 * 
 * Datastream objects should only be accessed using the read and write methods provided
 * in this module. The read method ensures all the fields of a datastream object are
 * retrieved as a coherent set in a threadsafe manner. The write function updates the 
 * fields atomically as well as signals execution of any callback functions that were 
 * registered with the particular datastream index.
 * 
 * The datastream module runs a thread to handle update events and execute registered
 * callback functions. The event loop registration helps decouple the code which updates
 * datastreams from the code that uses them.
