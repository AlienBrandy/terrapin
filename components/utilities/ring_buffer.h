/**
 * ring_buffer.h
 * 
 * Ciruclar buffer supporting variable length records.
 * This implementation of a ring buffer is designed for situations where records may
 * be different length, and the storage overhead of tracking record length and offset
 * is less than the memory potentially wasted by using a buffer with a fixed entry size
 * to hold the largest possible record.
 * 
 * This implementation utilizes a linked-list, in which a header preceeding every 
 * record contains the pointers to the previous and next records as well as the size
 * of the record. This amounts to 12 bytes overhead for each record. The oldest
 * records will be overwritten as necessary to make room for new ones. Depending on 
 * the record lengths, this overwrite strategy may orphan some memory at the end of
 * the buffer until the buffer has wrapped around and approaches the end again.
 * The benefit is that records are always contained in contiguous memory which
 * simplifies access.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * The methods are fairly straightforward. Create a new ring buffer by calling 
 * ring_buffer_create() which will do a one-time memory allocation. ring_buffer_add()
 * and ring_buffer_remove() are for adding and removing records respectively. The 
 * peek methods will fetch a record without removing it from the buffer. A read
 * pointer maintians the current peek position. peek_head() and peek_tail() set the 
 * read pointer, whereas peek_prev() and peek_next() move the read pointer by one
 * record. The read pointer will wrap at the end of the list.
