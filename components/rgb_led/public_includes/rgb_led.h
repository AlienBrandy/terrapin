 * device logic for the SK68XX tricolor LED
 * 
 * The SK68XX is an intelligent three-color LED module. There are separate light elements for
 * red, green, and blue, each of which can be set to a different intensity from 0=off to
 * 255=full brightness. Communication with the module is via a unipolar RZ (return-to-zero)
 * single-wire serial interface.
 * 
 * In the unipolar RZ protocol, a ONE is transmitted as a long high pulse followed by a shorter
 * low pulse, and a ZERO is transmitted as a short high pulse followed by a longer low pulse.
 * The module is self-timed; there is only a single transmission line for data with no clock.
 * 
 * This module uses the data line of an SPI interface to communicate with the LED. A command
 * packet is constructed by first packing the three RGB intensity values into 24 bits. Each bit
 * is then encoded for transmission by expanding it into three SPI data bits. A value of one is
 * encoded as b110 and a zero is encoded as b100. Zeroes are appended to the start and end of
 * the packet to generate a reset condition. The module changes state as soon as it receives
 * the second reset code.
 *
