/**
 * console_windows.h
 * 
 * windowing subsytem for ANSI terminals.
 * This module splits a terminal window vertically into separate scrolling regions, visually
 * demarcated by horizontal bars. Text is directed to a certain region using the putc(), 
 * printf(), and write() functions which include a window index.
 * 
 * The module currently defines two regions. Window 1 is at the bottom of the screen and
 * is hard-coded to four rows. Window 2 is at the top of the screen and it's height is
 * dynamically determined based on the terminal screen size. In this arrangement, window 1
 * can be used for single-line text input with a short scroll area to show previously
 * entered commands, and window 2 would be used for larger blocks of text such as menus
 * and status screens.
 * 
 * A terminal does not push updates when it's screen is resized. To detect resize events, 
 * the programmer must occasionally call console_windows_update_size() to fetch the current
 * screen size. If the size has changed, this function will repaint the screen and erase 
 * the contents of the windows.
 * 
 * Any output to the terminal through stdio functions will end up in whichever screen 
 * happened to be active. This may corrupt menus and prompts. console_windows_logf() has
 * a standard function signature and can be used to redirect stdio to the appropriate window.
 * console_windows_logf() directs output to window 2.
