/**
 * linenoise_lite.h
 * 
 * Line editing module based on open-source linenoise project.
 * This fork has been modified to remove periodic memory allocs and frees to make it
 * more suitable for embedded applications. Some functionality has been removed
 * to reduce the footprint and simplify the API. Notably the line completion and
 * multiline features have been removed. The history feature now leverages a statically 
 * allocated ring buffer, but it no longer saves/restores history from non-volatile storage.
 * A new init() function performs upfront allocation of the history and line buffers.

 * Guerrilla line editing library against the idea that a line editing lib
